## ðŸ”° important information
this is not a scam project! 
I am an active developer of two versions of the kernel (on traffic analysis and reading RAM via DMA) for Albion Online botting.  
You can make sure of my competence by watching the video demonstrating the work of my core here: https://www.youtube.com/@AlbionMasha

## ðŸ”° a concept idea for this radar
This radar is based on a basic version @fashionflora posted after a fight (according to Flora) with @FuckSBI a year ago. I made a temporary version based on it that supports getting enemies coordinates if they use their skils.
I have two subscriptions to renew and no time to farm. So give me 50,000,000 silver in game and I will activate this option. I'll also rewrite all the crappy code that's out there in abundance. And I'll make a new method of rendering through ImGui. The overlay will be transparent and will display on top of the game right out of the box. Also, enemies will be visible if they are using invisibility armor. They will be displayed as a phase that runs towards you.

Well, I've almost finished everything - just debugging and caching. Ideally this idea is shit, about what fuckSBI said yesterday - in this case I fully agree with him. Anyway, on JS I'll convert it for you in an hour and update it. Now I'm running away - I need to get the goods - and I will be only in 3 hours and will post a video with working radar on JS. Prepare 50,000,000 silver - or I'll never fucking update anything for you...

So in my version of radar you can interactively debug code directly in the visual studio instead of in the browser.
And you can practice a bit of programming if you are interested.
It is also completely safe because it is open source.
